                                Worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Onebyte. During this
                                internship, I worked with industry professionals to provide solution
                                to creating alert queries in Elasticsearch and Opensearch. I also
                                worked for the development of an API that manages all the requests to
                                a Hospital Management System's server. And I worked for the
                                documentation of HL7 which is a messaging format used for sharing
                                information by health care providers.

                                During this internship, I alongside my team worked on developing the
                                documentation of a health care application. Our goal was to provide a
                                design and architecture solution for a health care application that
                                manages a blood donation service and an ambulance service. Working
                                here I learnt how different problems are solved in software
                                development and what formats are used for communicating the
                                information to the stakeholders.
